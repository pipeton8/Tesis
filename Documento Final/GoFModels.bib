@techreport{GabaixIncome,
	Abstract = {The past forty years have seen a rapid rise in top income inequality in the United States. While there is a large number of existing theories of the Pareto tails of the income and wealth distributions at a given point in time, almost none of these address the fast rise in top inequality observed in the data. We show that standard theories, which build on a random growth mechanism, generate transition dynamics that are an order of magnitude too slow relative to those observed in the data. We then suggest parsimonious deviations from the basic model that can explain such changes, namely heterogeneity in mean growth rates or deviations from Gibrat's law. These deviations are consistent with theories in which the increase in top income inequality is driven by the rise of "superstar" entrepreneurs or managers.},

@inbook{OkFieldsIncome,
	Abstract = {Evaluation of distributions of income on the basis of equality is one of the most extensively studied topics in the general field of welfare economics. There is thus an enormous body of work devoted exclusively to the problem of the measurement of welfare and income inequality experienced by a given society.2 However, the majority of these studies are conducted in static terms, where the so-called ``snapshots''of the income distributions are taken as the primitives of the analysis. Nevertheless, static evaluations of income distributions can provide only an incomplete picture, for, in most instances, the social welfare would certainly depend on the dynamics of income distribution as well.3 This basic insight, along with the increased availability of longitudinal data sets, has led to a massive and rapidly expanding literature on the measurement of income mobility. This chapter surveys the highlights of this literature.},

We prove that the aggregate real exchange rate is persistent because its components have heterogeneous dynamics. Established time series and panel methods fail to control for this. Using Eurostat data, we find that when heterogeneity is taken into account, the estimated persistence of real exchange rates falls dramatically. Its half-life, for instance, may fall to as low as eleven months, significantly below the ``consensus view'' of three to five years.}},

@article{SchoolAggregation,
	Abstract = {This paper helps reconcile the contradictory findings about school resources and school effectiveness by developing the implications of data aggregation. With model misspecification, the theoretical impact of aggregation is generally ambiguous. When important state differences in school policy are omitted, however, aggregation implies clear upward bias of estimated school resource effects. Review of past studies and new empirical analysis provide strong evidence that aggregation inflates the coefficients on school resources. The pattern of results is also inconsistent with an errors-in-variables explanation. These results provide further support to the view that additional expenditures alone are unlikely to improve student outcomes.},

@article{Basu97,
	Abstract = {A typical (roughly) two‐digit industry in the United States appears to have constant or slightly decreasing returns to scale. Three puzzles emerge, however. First, estimates often rise at higher levels of aggregation. Second, apparent decreasing returns contradicts evidence of only small economic profits. Third, estimates with value added differ substantially from those with gross output. A representative‐firm paradigm cannot explain these puzzles, but a simple story of aggregation over heterogeneous units can. Theory and evidence on aggregation invalidate the common use of demand‐side instruments. Finally, we discuss implications of heterogencity for macroeconomic modeling: A one‐sector macroeconomic model that ignores heterogeneity may sometimes require firm‐level parameters, but at other times the model may require the ``biased'' aggregate parameters.},

Robust implementation of ε-optimal outcomes is thus robust to small perturbations of the environment.

@article{Morris97,
	Abstract = {{$[$}A number of papers have shown that a strict Nash equilibrium action profile of a game may never be played if there is a small amount of incomplete information (see, for example, Carlsson and van Damme (1993a)). We present a general approach to analyzing the robustness of equilibria to a small amount of incomplete information. A Nash equilibrium of a complete information game is said to be robust to incomplete information if every incomplete information game with payoffs almost always given by the complete information game has an equilibrium which generates behavior close to the Nash equilibrium. We show that many games with strict equilibria have no robust equilibrium and examine why we get such different results from existing refinements. If a game has a unique correlated equilibrium, it is robust. A natural many-player many-action generalization of risk dominance is a sufficient condition for robustness.{$]$}},
